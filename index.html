                <p>I'm a sophomore computer science student (with a minor in web design) at the University of Memphis. I like sports, cars, and video games. I would like to take this class to quickstart my coding skills past the fundamentals that I'm learning at school so that I could maybe use them as part of a side hustle to help pay for school.</p>
                <p>My superpower would probably be knowing the names of almost every Pokémon.</p> <!--I'm not great at writing about myself-->
